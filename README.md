# Sample Code To Start Project Using React

This is my sample code to start create React Project with Redux Saga.

## How To Use

1.  ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` to runnning the project
2.  ```npm run build``` or ```yarn build``` to build the project
3.  ```npm run eject``` or ```yarn eject``` to eject the core of react-script and modify the webpack configuration
4.  ```npm run server``` or ```yarn server``` to running server side rendering

## Deprecated Info

1.  Setting NODE_PATH to resolve modules absolutely has been deprecated in favor of setting baseUrl in jsconfig.json (or tsconfig.json if you are using TypeScript) and will be removed in a future major release of create-react-app.
